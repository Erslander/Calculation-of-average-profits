This is a simple Python program that calculates the average annual profit based on user input.
It repeatedly prompts the user to enter profit values for consecutive years and then computes the average once the user stops entering data.

Features

Accepts profit inputs for multiple years interactively

Calculates and displays the average profit with two decimal precision

Handles empty input gracefully (ends data entry when the user presses Enter)

Includes a separate function (compute_average) for clarity and modularity

How to Run

Clone the repository or download the script

Run the program in a terminal or Python IDE:

python profit_average_calculator.py


Enter yearly profits when prompted

Press Enter without typing a number to display the average

Example
Enter profits for year 1 (Press Enter to exit): 10000
Enter profits for year 2 (Press Enter to exit): 15000
Enter profits for year 3 (Press Enter to exit): 12000
Enter profits for year 4 (Press Enter to exit): 
Average profits: 12333.33
